title: My New Static Site
---
Welcome to my brand new website! I made it using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and it's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)! After trying for some time to get a good domain, I now finally have [tomsweeney.ca](http://tomsweeney.ca)! 

## What will be on this site?

### Projects
I'm going to try and do devlogs for any significant projects I start. I have many a google doc with project ideas. Hopefully at least one of them will be realized soon.

### Portfolio
I've done some projects in the past with varying levels of success. I used to make Nintendo DS homebrew games. 

### About Me
Info about me and where you can find me on social media and other places around the web.
