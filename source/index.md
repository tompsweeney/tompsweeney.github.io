title: Who is Tom Sweeney?
---
I'm a software developer who loves to learn new things. I've dabbled in many areas throughout my career: games, apps, web development, server administration, data science. I'm always searching for a new personal project to work on. 

## What is this site?

This is my home on the internet. Here you can see the projects I have done and read about things I plan to do.

### [Blog](/blog)
If I have anything non project related, I'll probably post it here.

### [Projects](/projects)
I'm going to try and do devlogs for any significant projects I start. I have many half baked ideas all sitting in Google Docs. Hopefully at least one of them will be realized soon. I also have some things I've done in the past which I will try to document here.

### [About Me](/aboutme)
Where you can find me on social media and other places around the web.
